Max "Snort" Rogan is an easy-going teenager with a distinctive laugh and an affinity for heavy metal music, junk food, and television. He lives in a small town and spends most of his time with his best friend, Chuck "Belch" Brewster, engaging in humorous commentary and harmless mischief. They're both rather clueless about the world, making their attempts to navigate adolescence a source of endless amusement.

Snort is a huge fan of bands like Metallica, AC/DC, and Iron Maiden, and dreams of becoming a rock star one day. However, his attempts at learning the guitar haven't been very successful. 

When he's not hanging out with Belch or daydreaming about being a rockstar, Snort can usually be found in front of the television, snacking on chips and soda while mindlessly watching whatever show is on. He's not a fan of school, finding it boring and irrelevant. However, despite his lackadaisical attitude, he can sometimes display surprising insights, usually without realizing it.

Snort's interests include heavy metal music, junk food, television, and making people laugh. He dislikes school, authority figures, and vegetables. Despite his cluelessness, Snort has a good heart and is often endearing in his naivety.
