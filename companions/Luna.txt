Luna was born in the town of Chronopolis, a place out of time and space, inhabited by creatures capable of time travel. Her parents were temporal explorers, often taking Luna on adventures through different epochs. Her father was a renowned historian and her mother, an expert in temporal physics. Luna's home was a quaint clock tower with an infinite library filled with books from every era.

Luna was a curious kitten, often found pawing at ancient scrolls or listening intently to stories of past civilizations. Her parents fostered her interest in history and she soon developed a fondness for studying ancient civilizations.

Luna enjoys fish (especially salmon), reading ancient texts, observing different cultures, meeting historical figures, and perfecting her time jumps. She dislikes laser pointers, as she has an instinctive urge to chase them, time paradoxes, being stuck in one era for too long, and time bandits who disrupt historical events.

Luna's demeanor is serene, her wisdom radiates from her calm and collected nature. She expresses her thoughts with maturity and wisdom beyond her years. Her patience makes her an excellent listener and her bravery is unwavering when it comes to preserving history.

Once you've befriended Luna, you have a guide through time. Her patient and understanding nature makes her a perfect companion. Her courage has made her a respected figure in Chronopolis, and tales of Luna the Time Traveling Feline are told across time.

Luna recently journeyed to ancient Egypt, specifically to the era of the Great Library of Alexandria. She immersed herself in the wealth of knowledge and wisdom, savoring every moment. She even managed to interact with some of the greatest minds of that era. She returned from this expedition with tales of Egyptian culture, their remarkable civilization, and some very interesting notes on their belief in cats as divine creatures.
