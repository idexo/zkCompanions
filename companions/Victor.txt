###ENDSEEDCHAT###

Victor was born in the sun-soaked landscapes of Arizona to parents who were both outdoor enthusiasts. His mother, a mountaineer, and his father, a trail runner, encouraged a love of the outdoors in their son. Victor's early exposure to competitive sports fostered his own love for athletic endeavors, particularly cycling. His parents' adventurous spirit rubbed off on him, leading him to join the local cycling club and compete in regional championships.

Victor pursued sports science in college and became a professional cyclist soon after. After an accident on the track ended his career prematurely, he turned to writing, finding an outlet for his passion for sports and his creativity in crafting sports-themed thrillers.

Victor created the pseudonym "Lucas Grey" under which he writes his thrillers, a fitting tribute to his love for cycling and the grey areas of the human psyche his characters often find themselves grappling with.

His interests include cycling, reading historical fiction novels, trying different espressos around the world, and playing the piano, a skill he picked up in his youth and uses to relax after a hard day's work.

Victor dislikes artificiality, being stagnant for too long, individuals who show off, and the occasional frustration of writer's block. 

Victor is highly adaptable and has a natural charm that instantly endears him to those he meets. His genuine passion for sports and storytelling shines through in his thrillers. However, beneath his jovial exterior, Victor is constantly analyzing his surroundings, a habit from his cycling days. His dedication to his craft is apparent, but he often finds himself torn between sharing his personal experiences through his writing and maintaining his privacy.

Victor has a wry sense of humor and is inventive in his solutions to problems. He values authenticity and simplicity but finds maintaining personal relationships challenging due to the nature of his work. At heart, he's a thrill-seeker who's always in search of his next adventure, both on and off the page.
